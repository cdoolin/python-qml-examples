Configuring QtCreator
---------------------

These projects contain a .qmlproject file which allows QtCreator to open them as
projects.  Note the `Files` object added to cause the recognition of `.py` files
in the project tree.

Normally QtCreator will try and run the qml files with qml-scene.  To get it to
run the python file instead, open the 'Projects' mode and

1.  Under 'Run', add a new 'Custom Executable' run configuration.
    Choose your python executable and set the .py file to run in the
    command line arguments field.

(on Windows)
2.  Under the 'Run Environment', change the environment from 'Build Environment'
    to 'System Environment'.  This let's PyQt5 find it's own Qt .dlls properly.
